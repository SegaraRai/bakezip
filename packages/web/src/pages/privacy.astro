      <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>BakeZip operates entirely within your browser.</strong> When you use
        BakeZip to create or modify zip files, your files are processed locally on
        your device using WebAssembly technology. We do not upload your files to any
        server, and we do not have access to the contents of your files. We may log
        your access to the website, but we never collect your zip files or any information
        contained within them.

        your browser's Local Storage to save your preferences, such as your
        selected theme or language settings, to improve your experience on
